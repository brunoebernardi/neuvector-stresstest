#### Instructions for CRDs

If you use CRDs to visualize their processing in NeuVector, you must enter their names and files in the same directory, using the crd.txt and namespaces.txt files. 

##### NOTE: To better visualize the processing of CRDs in real time, it is recommended to run these scripts in parallel with the REST API scripts.

#### Execution Logs

The execution logs will be inserted in the "executive-logs" directory.
