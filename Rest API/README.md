#### Instructions for execution

The rest API tasks have different tasks to overload the NeuVector controllers during the creation and verification of these resources. The "fire-scripts.sh" script should be executed first, as it has a parallel call method for all scripts. You need to declare your controller IP and Port through the Shell scripts.

#### Parallel executions

The "api-rest-*.sh" scripts can be run many times to execute as many runs as possible. It is up to the user to define the desired number.
